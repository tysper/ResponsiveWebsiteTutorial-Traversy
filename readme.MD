#Responsive Website Project

Hello. Nice to see you here, this is a project created by following a tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4">Traversy Media</a> to practice the following skills:

- Responsive Layout;
- Serverless Deployment;
- Grid Layouts;
- Flebox Layouts;
- Javascript DOM Manipulation;
- Design Patterns;
- CSS Animations.

It was a fun project to build and I definitely got some tricks that will follow my carreer forever.
